title: "About Me"
---

Hi, I'm **Haeward**, a programmer who enjoys building things with **Java**, **Python**, and **Go**. I also have some experience with **DevOps**, making sure everything runs smoothly from development to deployment.

When I'm not writing code, you can usually find me with my nose in a book, exploring new worlds through movies, or hitting the pavement for a run. I'm a firm believer that the best ideas often come when you're away from the keyboard.

Currently, I'm diving deep into **Rust** and learning **Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û)**. I'm also a huge fan of productivity tools and the latest electronics that make life a little more efficient and fun.

I love discovering and reading blogs from interesting people. In fact, they're a big part of what inspired me to start my own, so I compiled a list of [The blogs I often read](https://blog.haeward.com/blog/the-blogs-i-often-read).
