title: "About Me"
---

I'm **Haeward**, a software developer with experience in Java, Python, and Go, currently focusing on **Rust**. As an open source enthusiast, I believe in the power of collaborative development and aspire to contribute more meaningfully to the community.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading books, watching films and anime, particularly mystery and science fiction genres. I'm fascinated by the intricate logic of detective stories and captivated by the boundless imagination of sci-fi narratives.

I also maintain a consistent running practice, inspired by the anime **[È¢®„ÅåÂº∑„ÅèÂêπ„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã](https://bgm.tv/subject/248154)** (Run with the Wind). As the story beautifully captures:

> "Why can't we give up running even though it's so painful and hard? Because every cell in our body is restless, wanting to feel the strong wind blowing against us."

I'm passionate about productivity tools and emerging technologies that enhance daily workflows. From automation scripts to the latest development tools, I enjoy exploring solutions that make work more efficient and enjoyable. I also have a keen interest in hardware and gadgets that blend functionality with innovation.

Currently learning **Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û)**. I'd love to connect if you're interested in discussing Japanese language or culture.
